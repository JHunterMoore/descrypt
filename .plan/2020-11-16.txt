This is the initial drop of my files from school.
This is a barely decent implementation that worked well for the class.
There is more that I would like to see done with this before it is complete.

- Fix read-in issue with the last set of 1-7 characters in the file.
    Right now there is an issue with reading bytes that are not an even multiple of 8.
    That is due to an inadequate understanding of the bytes being read in when it was last worked on.

- Begin changing the project to a pure C language
    The program was already written to minimize use of C++ functions because of differences between my professor's computer and mine.
    I did not know enough about C at the time to write in plain C, but this is clearly the better choice given how it is currently written.

- Fix options to use '-' options rather than a strict syntax
    Having more experience with the command line, this is clearly the better way to handle the options

- Combine 'desencrypt' and 'desdecrypt' into one program

- Create separate files for des functions and methods.
    Break up the files to be used by other programs.

- Implement TripleDES as "3descrypt" to make it a more practical project.

- Hash the keys to add randomization and allow for more words and phrases to be used with the length constrained.
